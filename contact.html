            <p> <h3> George Malcolm </h3>
        <img src="paul-castanie-fG_ud73U_ZM-unsplash.jpg" alt="George Malcolm Profile Picture" width="400" height="250">
         <p>Demographic:</p>
         <ul> <li> Age: 22 </li>
         <li> Location: Sydney, Australia</li>
         <li> Occupation: Part-time University Student and Freelance Photographer</li>
         </ul> 
          <p> Needs </p>
          <ul> <li> George wanted to donate and support a local charity that specalises in animal rescue. Coming across the charities website, George wanted to find the easiest way that he could support the cause.</li> </ul>
          <p> Motivation </p>
           <ul> <li> Starting from a young age George owned many pet including dogs, cats and parrots but not yet a farm animal. Upon reaching the age of 16 he applied to the Agriculture subject in his highschool and from then he understood struggles of looking after farm animals. He hope to be part of a cause that aligns with his views of supporting farm animals and prevent any inadequate treatments.</li> </ul>
          <p> Frustration and Obstacles </p>
          <ul> <li> The website has really nice content and the logo is really nice but the size of the text along with the lack of interactive elements are points that don't attract me to this service. However the cause is good and I would like to continue getting involved with TIL THE COWS COME HOME</li> </ul> 
          <blockquote>
				"There are a lot of supporting animals charity but I have yet seen one that specialises in farm animals"
			</blockquote>
      <p> <em>Listed above here is a quote from George himself and it is a strong support to why people choose to support us</em></p>

      <h3> Britney Heartsworne </h3>
        <img src="britney.jpg" alt="Britney Hearsworne Profile Picture" width="400" height="250">
         <p>Demographic:</p>
         <ul> <li> Age: 18 </li>
         <li> Location: Tasmania, Australia</li>
         <li> Occupation: Year 12 Highschool Student</li>
         </ul> 
          <p> Needs </p>
          <ul> <li> Being an animal lover Britney wants to get involved in a cause. Owning 3 pets and living in a modern society where pets are sometimes neglected it's something Britney doesn't wish to see. </li> </ul>
          <p> Motivation </p>
           <ul> <li> She hopes to volunteer to be part of the team that helps with the adoption of the farm animals on top of donating what she could with her pockey money. She uses the website to navigate and to find the latest news with the teams actions.</li> </ul>
          <p> Frustration and Obstacles </p>
          <ul> <li> TIL THE COWS COME HOME is a great charity name and a very catchy name as a slogan but she wonders if people only think this is only about cows. The website has the essential adoption and donation information but the lack of interactive elements such as a journey progress map where users can click and enter the page makes her wonder if people really likes the website or not. </li> </ul>
