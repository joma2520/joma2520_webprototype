            <p> People often don't realise what the difference between charity and non-profit organisations are but it is vital for people to understand this.

Charity is a type of non-profit organisation where the organisation had met a strict set of requirements and endorsed by both the Australia Charities and Non-for-profits Commision and the Australian Tax Office.

We operate as an animal rescue groups specialised in bringing unwanted farm animals to a safe shelter, providing them with resource they need until a suitable home is found. Farm animals are often neglected after their initial profit purpose and our purpose and mission here is to save them and invite animal lovers to either adopting or donating to the cause. </p>
            <p class="dark"> We operate within NSW but with enough support we can expand to other regions!! </p>

                <h3> What we do </h3>
                <p> Australia has long had foster homes for people, cats, dogs and wildlife. I thought “Why not farmed animals too?”.</p>

<p>Today ‘Til The Cows Come Home is Australia’s leading online adoption agency for farmed animals. We have foster carers across Australia enabling adopters to turn their homes into forever homes for these deserving souls. From ducks to camels, feather, fur or skin we help them all.  </p>
